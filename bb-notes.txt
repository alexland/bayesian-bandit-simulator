mab is a heuristic framework for an automatic feedback loop in split-path testing

epsilon greedy: 

	(i) explore vs exploit
	
		explore: select a lever at random
		
		exploit: select arm with best performance so far
		
	epsilon-greedy will choose to test w/ frequency of epsilon
		1.0 => always test
		
		

for i in range(n_trials):

    (i) sample a random variable Xb from the prior of bandit b, for all b
	
	(ii) select the bandit with largest sample, i.e. select B=argmax * b
	
	(iii) observe the result of pulling bandit B, then update your prior on bandit B
	

initial priors are Beta(α=1,β=1) (a uniform distribution)

observed result is a binomial

posterior is  Beta(α=1+X,β=1+1−X).
